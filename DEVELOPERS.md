<h2><i>How to Setup and Launch the Project :</i></h2>

### GitBash Configuration

If you want to clone the project correctly, you must install [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
If you don't install it, your computer doesn't have the environment variable to clone the project.
But you can Download it with GitUI but it's not recommended.

### Clone Project

Open your terminal (CMD, Bash, PowerShell, ...)

Go to the GitLab Repository and Copy the URL.
